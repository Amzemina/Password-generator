# Password-generator

## Description
This webpage is used to generate a random password for any user. It can generate a password using uppercase, and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters/symbols. To use, click the generate password button and answer the prompts that pop up at the top of the webpage.
To make this I used VS code to code the JavaScript.
